## What's new in phase 3?! :blush:
1. Integration of youtube api to provide trailers for the recommended movies.
2. Implemented User Authentication by developing a register and login page.
3. Users are now able to create an account and access their account history (Liked movies, Disliked movies and movies yet to watch) for previously recommended movies.
4. Integrated a Database using SQL alchemy to store user related data and movies.
5. Enhanced the user interface.
6. Fixed bugs related to feedback of recommended movies.


## Future Project Plan 🔮

Following is what the future developers can add! :

1. Create a dynamic movie list instead of using an existing movie csv file.
2. Build a new feature that exhibits diversity across genres, casting choices, and production styles.
3. Enhance the user profile page.


Note: Our system can be virtually tested through Github Actions inbuilt feature of build and test queries using python.

Make sure you taste your own medicine first and take into account other peoples familiarity with the system before you design your tests.

## Working 📱

- Below working displays the system also evaluates movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and user-generated reviews. 
- By combining these user-specific data and film characteristics, the recommender system employs machine learning to generate tailored movie recommendations.
- This enables users to discover new films that align with their individual tastes, making the movie-watching experience more enjoyable and engaging. 
- Furthermore, recommender systems often employ a feedback loop, where users' interactions and feedback help refine the recommendations over time, ensuring that the suggestions remain relevant.
